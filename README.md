# School_ACTSoftware_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare students’ scores on a CERT practice ACT assessment with their recent ACT scores in order to determine the validity of using the CERT assessment as a predictor of/prep for Siegel High School’s ACT scores. Additionally, this analysis seeks to clarify what, if any, relationship exists between Seigel High School (SGH) student performance on CERT practice ACT assessment and SGH student ACT scores. <br /> <br />

## Research Questions
The following research questions were generated to guide the analyses and were decided upon by committee in order to qualify differences between sets of data. 
<ol>
    <li>Does SGH ACT score (average) match the schoolwide CERT score?</li>
    <li>On a student-by-student basis, are SGH student ACT scores significantly different than their corresponding CERT scores?</li>
    <li>Are there particular subgroups of the school, or subtests of the ACT, for which the CERT assessment is (more) accurate and precise? (I.e., for English department, female students, those taking honors math/English, etc.)</li>
    <li>Is the distribution of ACT scores for SGH students different than the distribution of CERT scores?</li>
    <li>Are there correlations between students’ CERT scores and ACT scores?</li>
    <li>Can a predictive model be created using the subsets of the CERT assessment data to predict how a student may have performed on their ACT test or subtest? (If so, is the model strong?</li>
</li>
